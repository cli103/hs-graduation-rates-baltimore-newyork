# Comparing High School Graduation Rates of Baltimore, MD and New York, NY with Opportunity Atlas Data
## Background

For this assignment, we were asked to use Microsoft Excel to conduct data analysis about a social metric in Baltimore, Maryland and our hometown (or an interesting US city). As I am an international student, I have chosen to conduct the analysis on New York, New York as this is the US city I am most familiar with.

The social metric I have chosen is high school graduation rates as education has always been an important factor in my life and I am interested to learn about how the rates differ across US cities. I also think that the city of New York will be an interesting comparison to Baltimore as the socioeconomic landscapes of the cities are quite different.

I will be using open data collected by the Opportunity Atlas to analyze the high school graduation rates of the counties of Baltimore, MD and New York, NY and the average graduation rate in each city compared with the national average. 

## Business Question
How do the high school graduation rates of Baltimore, Maryland and New York, New York compare to the national average? 

## Data Sources â€“ Open Data

1.	[Opportunity Atlas](https://www.opportunityatlas.org/): They collect data from US cities on a variety of metrics including household income, incarceration rates, teenage birth rates, high school graduation rates, and more. Below is the data used in this analysis:
- [High School Graduation Rates in Baltimore, MD](https://github.com/cli103/hs-graduation-rates-baltimore-newyork/blob/main/shown_cty_hs_rP_gP_pall%20(1).csv)
- [High School Graduation Rates in New York, NY](https://github.com/cli103/hs-graduation-rates-baltimore-newyork/blob/main/shown_cty_hs_rP_gP_pall.csv)
2.	[US News](https://www.usnews.com/education/best-high-schools/articles/see-high-school-graduation-rates-by-state): The US News article was used to obtain information regarding the national average high school graduation rate. The reported national graduation rate is approximately 88% as of April 22, 2020. 
    The National Center for Education Statistics reports on [public high school graduation rates](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/indicator_coi.asp#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20average%20ACGR%20for,85%20percent%20in%202017%E2%80%9318) and listed it as 85% in 2017-18, however, as the data excludes private high schools, I decided to use the statistic from the US News article.

## Data Analysis
I will use Microsoft Excel to:
- Compare the graduation rates of different counties in Baltimore, Maryland and New York, New York
- Compare the graduation rates of different counties to the city average

### Data Answer
Looking at the charts below, we find that the rate of high school graduation in both Baltimore and New York are higher than the national average of 88% with the average city rates at 89.32% and 89.67% respectively. Both Baltimore and New York maintain high school graduation rates at least 1% above the national average. 

When comparing the average high school graduation rates of Baltimore and New York, there is only a marginal difference. However, when comparing each city county to the city average and to the national average, there is greater variation. Some counties fall more than 5% below the city and national rates, notably: Baltimore City, Bronx County and New York County. It is suggested that a greater effort be made to encourage high school students to stay in school in these areas as their graduation rate is significantly lower than other areas within their city and across the nation. Programs involving high school peers or college students may help to convince students to stay in school.
